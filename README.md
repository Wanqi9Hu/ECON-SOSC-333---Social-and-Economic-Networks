Class Description: 

Individuals are embedded in a network of relationships used to exchange information and favors, access economic opportunities and share risk. The structure of these relationships determine the individualâ€™s opportunities and the aggregate outcomes of social and economic systems. The course will discuss the typical properties of network structures (e.g. 6-degrees of separation, clustering, homophily and segregation), how network ties are formed and how agents interact through these ties. Students will learn about a wide range of applications, including the spread of diseases, fashions and political opinion; financial networks; networks in organizations and the labor market; online social networks, etc.
